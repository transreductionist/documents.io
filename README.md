## Some StackOverflow Links

- [Intersection of curves and a bisection routine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31102754/find-intersection-of-ax-and-by-in-complex-plane-plus-corr-x-and-y/31225836#31225836)

>Briefly, two analytic solutions are derived for the roots of the problem. The first solution removes the parametric representation of x and solves for the roots directly in the (u, v) plane, where for example A(x): u(x) + i v(y) gives v(u) = f(u). The second solution uses a polar representation, e.g. A(x) is given by r(x) exp(i theta(x)), and offers a better understanding of the behavior of the square root as x passes through unity towards zero.

- [Python run unittest as package import error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47935707/python-run-unittest-as-package-import-error/47944461#47944461)

> It is worthwhile mentioning up front that the Flask documents say to run the application as a package, and set the environment variable: FLASK_APP. The application then runs from the project root: $ python -m flask run. Now the imports will include the application root, such as app.models.transactions. Since the unittest is being run in the same way, as a package from the project root, all imports are resolved there as well.

## Considerations

The intellectual, the moral, the religious seem to me all naturally bound up and interlinked together in one great and harmonious whole.

―Ada Lovelace

---

I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.

―Oscar Wilde

---

I don't feel that it is necessary to know exactly what I am. The main interest in life and work is to become someone else that you were not in the beginning.

―Michel Foucault

---

A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being. Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

―C. J. Jung

---

Always try to innovate. If you lose your old fitness, you lose out to Bose-Einstein condensation. I am sure that companies that go under would feel better if they knew that they were victims of Bose-Einstein condensation.

―Jennifer Tour Chayes

Progress was all right. Only it went on too long.

―James Thurber

If you find that you're spending almost all your time on theory, start turning some attention to practical things; it will improve your theories. If you find that you're spending almost all your time on practice, start turning some attention to theoretical things; it will improve your practice.  

―Donald Knuth

With sixty staring me in the face, I have developed inflammation of the sentence structure and definite hardening of the paragraphs. 

―James Thurber

---
It is my purpose to transmit the importance of good taste and style in programming, [but] the specific elements of style presented serve only to illustrate what benefits can be derived from "style" in general. In this respect I feel akin to the teacher of composition at a conservatory: He does not teach his pupils how to compose a particular symphony, he must help his pupils to find their own style and must explain to them what is implied by this.  

―Edsger Dijkstra

---

Where love rules, there is no will to power, and where power predominates, love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.

―C. J. Jung

---

If we want technology to serve society rather than enslave it, we have to build systems accessible to all people - be they male or female, young, old, disabled, computer wizards or technophobes.

―Anita Borg

---

Changes and progress very rarely are gifts from above. They come out of struggles from below.

―Noam Chomsky

---

Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure mathematicians.

―Edsger Dijkstra  

---

Combinatorialists and analysts always have different names for everything, in order to keep themselves from interacting.

―Jennifer Tour Chayes

---

What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is related only to objects and not to individuals, or to life. That art is something which is specialized or which is done by experts who are artists. But couldn't everyone's life become a work of art? Why should the lamp or the house be an art object, but not our life?

―Michel Foucault

---

The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.  

―Donald Knuth

---

Remember then: there is only one time that is important – now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when we have any power. The most necessary person is the one with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with anyone else: and the most important affair is to do that person good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life.  

―Tolstoy

---

There are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, 'That person I see is a savage monster;' instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do. 

―Noam Chomsky

---

You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward.

―James Thurber

---
Knowledge is not for knowing: knowledge is for cutting.

―Michel Foucault

---

In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation.

―Ada Lovelace

---

The evolutionists, piercing beneath the show of momentary stability, discovered, hidden in rudimentary organs, the discarded rubbish of the past. They detected the reptile under the lifted feathers of the bird, the lost terrestrial limbs dwindling beneath the blubber of the giant cetaceans. They saw life rushing outward from an unknown center, just as today the astronomer senses the galaxies fleeing into the infinity of darkness. As the spinning galactic clouds hurl stars and worlds across the night, so life, equally impelled by the centrifugal powers lurking in the germ cell, scatters the splintered radiance of consciousness and sends it prowling and contending through the thickets of the world.

―Loren Eisley

---

Don't be afraid to say "I don't know" or "I don't understand" – no question is a dumb question.

―Margarat Hamilton

---

The truth is rarely pure and never simple.

―Oscar Wilde

---

Either you repeat the same conventional doctrines everybody is saying, or else you say something true, and it will sound like it's from Neptune. 

―Noam Chomsky

---

If I have any beliefs about immortality, it is that certain dogs I have known will go to heaven, and very, very few persons.

―James Thurber

---

London is too full of fogs and serious people. Whether the fogs produce the serious people, or whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don't know.

―Oscar Wilde

---

It's when I'm weary of considerations,  
And life is too much like a pathless wood  
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs  
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping  
From a twig's having lashed across it open.  
I'd like to get away from earth awhile  
And then come back to it and begin over.  
May no fate willfully misunderstand me  
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away  
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:  
I don't know where it's likely to go better.  

―Robert Frost

---

This wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. Either it goes or I do.

―Oscar Wilde

---

The process of shaping opinion, attitudes, and perceptions was termed the 'engineering of consent' by one of the founders of the modern public relations industry, Edward Bernays. 

―Noam Chomsky

---

You are the way and the wayfarers. And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone. Aye, and he falls for those ahead of him, who, though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.  

―Kahlil Gibran

---

The mark of all good art is not that the thing done is done exactly or finely, for machinery may do as much, but that it is worked out with the head and the workman's heart.

―Oscar Wilde

---

Maybe the target nowadays is not to discover what we are but to refuse what we are.

―Michel Foucault

---


For the first time in four billion years a living creature had contemplated himself and heard with a sudden, unaccountable loneliness, the whisper of the wind in the night reeds.  

―Loren Eisley

---

Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.

―Oscar Wilde

---

Everyone who has his eyes and wits about him can see that the world is dead, cold, and unending. Never yet has he beheld a God, or been compelled to require the existence of such a God from the evidence of his senses. On the contrary, it needed the strongest inner compulsion, which can only be explained by the irrational force of existence, for man to invent those religious beliefs whose absurdity was long since pointed out by Tertullian.

―C. J. Jung

---

If you see a better world, you're morally obligated to create it.

―Genevieve Bell

---

The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful. 

―Noam Chomsky

---
Man is a reed, the weakest of nature, but he is a thinking reed. It is not necessary that the entire universe arm itself to crush: a vapor, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than what kills him, because he knows that he dies and the advantage that the universe has over him, the universe does knows nothing.

―Blaise Pascal

---

Looking back, we were the luckiest people in the world. There was no choice but to be pioneers; no time to be beginners.

―Margarat Hamilton

---

The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.

―Michel Foucault

The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future. 

―Oscar Wilde

---

Can true humility and compassion exist in our words and eyes until we know we too are capable of any act?

―St Francis of Assisi

---

As you deal with more and more complex systems, it becomes harder and harder to find deep and interesting properties. 

―Noam Chomsky

---

I'm no prophet. My job is making windows where there were once walls.

―Michel Foucault

---

The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the humorist makes fun of himself, but in so doing, he identifies himself with people - that is, people everywhere, not for the purpose of taking them apart, but simply revealing their true nature.

―James Thurber

---

One of the many lessons that one learns in prison is, that things are what they are and will be what they will be.

―Oscar Wilde
