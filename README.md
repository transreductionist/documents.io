## Some StackOverflow Links

- [Intersection of curves and a bisection routine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31102754/find-intersection-of-ax-and-by-in-complex-plane-plus-corr-x-and-y/31225836#31225836)

>Briefly, two analytic solutions are derived for the roots of the problem. The first solution removes the parametric representation of x and solves for the roots directly in the (u, v) plane, where for example A(x): u(x) + i v(y) gives v(u) = f(u). The second solution uses a polar representation, e.g. A(x) is given by r(x) exp(i theta(x)), and offers a better understanding of the behavior of the square root as x passes through unity towards zero.

> Here is an example that will prove useful when there are many enumerations. It uses structures in Golang, and draws upon Object Oriented Principles to tie them all together in a neat little bundle. 

- [Python run unittest as package import error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47935707/python-run-unittest-as-package-import-error/47944461#47944461)

> It is worthwhile mentioning up front that the Flask documents say to run the application as a package, and set the environment variable: FLASK_APP. The application then runs from the project root: $ python -m flask run. Now the imports will include the application root, such as app.models.transactions. Since the unittest is being run in the same way, as a package from the project root, all imports are resolved there as well.
