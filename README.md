## Some StackOverflow Links

- [Intersection of curves and a bisection routine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31102754/find-intersection-of-ax-and-by-in-complex-plane-plus-corr-x-and-y/31225836#31225836)

>Briefly, two analytic solutions are derived for the roots of the problem. The first solution removes the parametric representation of x and solves for the roots directly in the (u, v) plane, where for example A(x): u(x) + i v(y) gives v(u) = f(u). The second solution uses a polar representation, e.g. A(x) is given by r(x) exp(i theta(x)), and offers a better understanding of the behavior of the square root as x passes through unity towards zero.

> Here is an example that will prove useful when there are many enumerations. It uses structures in Golang, and draws upon Object Oriented Principles to tie them all together in a neat little bundle. 

- [Python run unittest as package import error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47935707/python-run-unittest-as-package-import-error/47944461#47944461)

> It is worthwhile mentioning up front that the Flask documents say to run the application as a package, and set the environment variable: FLASK_APP. The application then runs from the project root: $ python -m flask run. Now the imports will include the application root, such as app.models.transactions. Since the unittest is being run in the same way, as a package from the project root, all imports are resolved there as well.

- [Deploying django to aws & wsgipath refers to file that does not exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29395875/deploying-django-to-aws-wsgipath-refers-to-a-file-that-does-not-exist/29981741#29981741)

> The problem that was identified existed in the config.yml where there is the key-pair for application_name:

If you find that you're spending almost all your time on theory, start turning some attention to practical things; it will improve your theories. If you find that you're spending almost all your time on practice, start turning some attention to theoretical things; it will improve your practice.

It is my purpose to transmit the importance of good taste and style in programming, [but] the specific elements of style presented serve only to illustrate what benefits can be derived from "style" in general. In this respect I feel akin to the teacher of composition at a conservatory: He does not teach his pupils how to compose a particular symphony, he must help his pupils to find their own style and must explain to them what is implied by this.

The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.

Remember then: there is only one time that is important â€“ now! It is the most important time because it is the only time when we have any power. The most necessary person is the one with whom you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with anyone else: and the most important affair is to do that person good, because for that purpose alone was man sent into this life.

The evolutionists, piercing beneath the show of momentary stability, discovered, hidden in rudimentary organs, the discarded rubbish of the past. They detected the reptile under the lifted feathers of the bird, the lost terrestrial limbs dwindling beneath the blubber of the giant cetaceans. They saw life rushing outward from an unknown center, just as today the astronomer senses the galaxies fleeing into the infinity of darkness. As the spinning galactic clouds hurl stars and worlds across the night, so life, equally impelled by the centrifugal powers lurking in the germ cell, scatters the splintered radiance of consciousness and sends it prowling and contending through the thickets of the world.

It's when I'm weary of considerations,  
And life is too much like a pathless wood  
Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs  
Broken across it, and one eye is weeping  
From a twig's having lashed across it open.  
I'd like to get away from earth awhile  
And then come back to it and begin over.  
May no fate willfully misunderstand me  
And half grant what I wish and snatch me away  
Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:  
I don't know where it's likely to go better.

You are the way and the wayfarers. And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone. Aye, and he falls for those ahead of him, who, though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.

For the first time in four billion years a living creature had contemplated himself and heard with a sudden, unaccountable loneliness, the whisper of the wind in the night reeds.
